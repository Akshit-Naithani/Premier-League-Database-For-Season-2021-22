# Premier-League-Database-For-Season-2021-22
This is a SQL project database on the premier league season 21-22 season. Created using CSVs of all the teams containing information like Goals, Assists, Appearance, Shirt Number, etc. for all the player at the various 20 clubs in the PL (premier league). The project includes all the CSVs of all the teams and loader files. The loader files were used to quickly import all the CSVs and create tables instantly. Relationships then can be defined in the SQL application using the traditional methods. This repository also includes a report and presentation on the project. The report includes the Entity-Relationship diagram which defines all the relationship between the tables.
